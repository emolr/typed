<h2>OUR CATS</h2>
<h3>AND ALL ABOUT THEM.</h3>
<p>After a Cat Show at the Crystal Palace, I usually receive a number of
	letters requesting information. One asks: "What is a true tortoiseshell
	like?" Another: "What is a tabby?" and yet another: "What is a blue
	tabby?" One writes of the "splendid disposition" of his cat, another
	asks how to cure a cat scratching the furniture, and so on.</p>
<p>After much consideration, and also at the request of many, I have
	thought it best to publish my notes on cats, their ways, habits,
	instincts, peculiarities, usefulness, colours, markings, forms, and
	other qualities that are required as fitting subjects to exhibit at what
	is now one of the instituted exhibitions of "The land we live in," and
	also the Folk and other lore, both ancient and modern, respecting them.</p>
<p>It is many years ago that, when thinking of the large number of cats
	kept in London alone, I conceived the idea that it would be well to
	hold "Cat Shows," so that the different breeds, colours, markings, etc.,
	might be more carefully attended to, and the domestic cat, sitting in
	front of the fire, would then possess a beauty and an attractiveness to
	its owner unobserved and unknown because uncultivated heretofore.
	Prepossessed with this view of the subject, I called on my friend Mr.
	Wilkinson, the then manager of the Crystal Palace. With his usual
	businesslike clear-headedness, he saw it was "a thing to be done." In a
	few days I presented my scheme in full working order: the schedule of
	prizes, the price of entry, the number of classes, and the points by
	which they would be judged, the number of prizes in each class, their
	amount, the different varieties of colour, form, size, and sex for which
	they were to be given; I also made a drawing of the head of a cat to be
	printed in black on yellow paper for a posting bill. Mr. F. Wilson, the
	Company's naturalist and show manager, then took the matter in charge,
	worked hard, got a goodly number of cats together, among which was my
	blue tabby, "The Old Lady," then about fourteen years old, yet the best
	in the show of its colour and never surpassed, though lately possibly
	equalled. To my watch-chain I have attached the silver bell she wore at
	her <i>début</i>.</p>
<p>My brother, John Jenner Weir, the Rev. J. Macdona, and myself acted as
	judges, and the result was a success far beyond our most sanguine
	expectations—so much so that I having made it a labour of love of the
	feline race, and acting "without fee, gratuity, or reward," the Crystal
	Palace Company generously presented me with a large silver tankard in
	token of their high approval of my exertions on behalf of "the Company,"
	and—Cats. Now that a Cat Club is formed, shows are more numerous, and
	the entries increasing, there is every reason to expect a permanent
	benefit in every way to one of the most intelligent of (though often
	much abused) animals.</p>
<h2>THE FIRST CAT SHOW.</h2>
<p>On the day for judging, at Ludgate Hill I took a ticket and the train
	for the Crystal Palace. Sitting alone in the comfortable cushioned
	compartment of a "first class," I confess I felt somewhat more than
	anxious as to the issue of the experiment. Yes; what would it be like?
	Would there be many cats? How many? How would the animals comport
	themselves in their cages? Would they sulk or cry for liberty, refuse
	all food? or settle down and take the situation quietly and resignedly,
	or give way to terror? I could in no way picture to myself the scene; it
	was all so new. Presently, and while I was musing on the subject, the
	door was opened, and a friend got in. "Ah!" said he, "how are you?"
	"Tolerably well," said I; "I am on my way to the Cat Show." "What!"
	said my friend, "that surpasses everything! A show of cats! Why, I hate
	the things; I drive them off my premises when I see them. You'll have a
	fine bother with them in their cages! Or are they to be tied up? Anyhow,
	what a noise there will be, and how they will clutch at the bars and try
	and get out, or they will strangle themselves with their chains." "I am
	sorry, very sorry," said I, "that you do not like cats. For my part, I
	think them extremely beautiful, also very graceful in all their actions,
	and they are quite as domestic in their habits as the dog, if not more
	so. They are very useful in catching rats and mice; they are not
	deficient in sense; they will jump up at doors to push up latches with
	their paws. I have known them knock at a door by the knocker when
	wanting admittance. They know Sunday from the week-day, and do not go
	out to wait for the meat barrow on that day; they——" "Stop," said my
	friend, "I see you do like cats, and I do not, so let the matter drop."
	"No," said I, "not so. That is why I instituted this Cat Show; I wish
	every one to see how beautiful a well-cared-for cat is, and how docile,
	gentle, and—may I use the term?—cossetty. Why should not the cat that
	sits purring in front of us before the fire be an object of interest,
	and be selected for its colour, markings, and form? Now come with me, my
	dear old friend, and see the first Cat Show."</p>
<p>Inside the Crystal Palace stood my friend and I. Instead of the noise
	and struggles to escape, there lay the cats in their different pens,
	reclining on crimson cushions, making no sound save now and then a
	homely purring, as from time to time they lapped the nice new milk
	provided for them. Yes, there they were, big cats, very big cats,
	middling-sized cats, and small cats, cats of all colours and markings,
	and beautiful pure white Persian cats; and as we passed down the front
	of the cages I saw that my friend became interested; presently he said:
	"What a beauty this is! and here's another!" "And no doubt," said I,
	"many of the cats you have seen before would be quite as beautiful if
	they were as well cared for, or at least cared for at all; generally
	they are driven about and ill-fed, and often ill-used, simply for the
	reason that they are cats, and for no other. Yet I feel a great pleasure
	in telling you the show would have been much larger were it not for the
	difficulty of inducing the owners to send their pets from home, though
	you see the great care that is taken of them." "Well, I had no idea
	there was such a variety of form, size, and colour," said my friend, and
	departed. A few months after, I called on him; he was at luncheon, with
	two cats on a chair beside him—pets I should say, from their
	appearance.</p>
